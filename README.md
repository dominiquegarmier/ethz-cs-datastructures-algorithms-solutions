# Datastructures and Algorithms Solutions
Solutions for Datastructures and Algorithms course at ETHZ 

## Usage
Use this repository at your own risk. It is not recommended to blindly copy paste these solutions.

**Important** it is not allowed by the rules layed out by the professor to copy solutions for bonus excercies. Use these strictly for inspiration / error checking of your solution.

### python
Implementations in python are meant as mental guides when implementing the actual solution in cpp.

### Disclaimer
The maintainers of this repo **deny all responsablity**.

- Especially for issues related to missue of these resources not in accordance to the rules layed out by the professor.

- We do not guarantee correctness of any solutions. Hence it is up to the user to check for correctness before handing in.

## Submit a Solution

Make a local fork of this repo. Create a new branch for your solution (see [format](###Format)).
Then create a [pullrequest on GitHub](https://github.com/DominiqueGarmier/ethz-cs-datastructures-algorithms-solutions/compare), a maintainer will review your submission.

### Requirements
Your solution ...
- must pass all test cases.
- should be formated reasonably (see [cs50 sytleguide](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style/c/), [PEP8 for python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/))
- must comply with the [file format requirements](###Format)

### Format

fisrt take a look at [`./week_00`](./week_00/).
for each exercises add a new folder `./exercise_x` containing the following file:
    - `question.md` a markdown file containing the question (you can copy paste this directly from code expert)
    - `*.cpp, *.h ...` all cpp related files present in the filesystem of the code expert instance.
    - `*.py` solutions are also allowed as python files, only use the standardlibrary. Your code should be compatible with `>=python3.8`.
